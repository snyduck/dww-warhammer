              <h1>Welcome to the Sudenland</h1>
              <p>
                You were born in, or arrived to, the Barony of Sonnefurt, a
                growing realm in the southwestern hinterlands of the Empire.
                Positioned on both sides of two rivers that meet at a fork, the
                Soll and the Sonne, the realm makes the bulk of it's money by
                trade passing through it's stretches of the river and roads.
                Dwarfs from Karak Hirn to the south as well as Tileans and
                Bretonnians passing onwards from Kreutzhofen at the mouth of the
                River Soll have begun to make Sonnefurt into a rising,
                prosperous crossroads! While it is, in truth, still quite poor,
                it has an enviable position. Even the Border Princes have begun
                to explore paths through the Black Mountains to better reach the
                Icy Wind Pass road to the realm.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite this prosperity and general contentment, there are
                profound troubles festering. Greenskins, ever a plague upon old
                Solland, have been seen gathering in the forests. The Solland
                Independence movement, until recently only a concern of the
                conservative folk out east, has within the past year attempted
                to kill the Baroness von Heisenberg with explosives beneath her
                favored winery!
              </p>
              <p>
                While those responsible for this outrage were found and hanged,
                there are growing rumbles of discontent among the common folk
                with the Baroness' rule. Her steward, Tobias Brauer, the same
                steward her father had for his entire life, has grown less
                diplomatic in his old age, no longer displaying his previous
                skill at maneuvering the Council of Villages and Guilds. The
                Council, until the Baroness' reign, was a vestigial aspect of
                government - they are growing in wealth and power faster than
                most would suspect.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is into this that you were born and raised - perhaps you were
                recruited into the 1st Sonnefurt Regiment of Foote as militia,
                or perhaps you have grown up in Sonnefurt itself or one of the
                surrounding villages, moving to the town for it's greater
                opportunities. Either way, with trouble comes opportunity, and
                you hope to be part of that!
